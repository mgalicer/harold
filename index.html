            <br>

SeaKay Inc, a California public benefit corporation, was founded upon the vision that the not for profit sector could work better for everyone. SeaKay´s initiatives are an essential step towards the actualization of our mission in the communities we serve.<br><br>

SeaKay´s vision for ubiquitous broadband networks supported by service learning programs are the basis for a region´s pursuit of the rewards of the 21st century economy. Economic growth and renewal is brought about by a higher degree of connectivity – to resources, knowledge and capital. The vast resources that this network brings create what SeaKay calls Digital Opportunity.</p>

                                <h4>Digital Opportunity</h4>
                                <p>While digital opportunity focuses upon those in underserved populations who have not yet discovered the full range of possibilities from new technologies, it extends beyond this point. Digital opportunity also benefits new and emerging businesses, government entities seeking greater connection to those they inform and serve, and public safety and educational entities seeking to extend their reach and eliminate barriers to effectiveness. The Metro Connect network provides a basis for productive interaction for the entire community, offering a greater level of inclusion to all participating constituencies.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> SeaKay creates digital opportunity within a collaborative format, engaging the community, municipal entities, corporate technology leaders and educational institutions in networks that will be widely beneficial and sustainable over many years to come. A localized solution, built from the grassroots level creates a level of mutual respect and engagement around the network which ensures its value and relevance over time.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives feature a not for profit enabling success across multiple sectors, some of which may have previously been in adversarial relationships around the provision of communications and technology assets. Our public benefit focus engages them productively towards shared goals of new market development.
                                    <br> A not for profit, a traditional and trusted service provider upon communities rely, now holds an entrepreneurial role of community resource creation. In placing public benefit purpose at the network´s center, SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives enable the communities we serve to do the same.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The not for profit is at the hub of a new, innovative implementation of regional broadband networks. Our inclusive and interdisciplinary thought process envisions a wealth of possibilities in this valuable community investment. Our focus on public benefit generates both social and economic return. The model actualizes SeaKay´s mission of not–for–profit sector effectiveness in the following ways:
                                    <br>
                                    <br><br>Digital Opportunity enables an economic model in which communities may have confidence. Our sponsorship–centered model creates a network supported by diverse and independent revenue sources, ensuring a sustainable and capable network over time.
                                    <br><br>SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives create a truly open network that goes beyond the perhaps narrower offering of a single provider. An open, freely competitive marketplace on a ubiquitous access framework enables greater choice for all users of the network. A free public benefit layer works in tandem with a commercial layer to provide a wide array of applications, content and options for both new and seasoned network users.
                                    <br><br>Digital Opportunity enables a locally built solution that´s more meaningful to all constituencies. It promotes community self–reliance, responsibility and ownership of results. This contributes not just to the networks revenue viability, but also ensures a source of positive messaging and local pride.
                                    <br><br>SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives recognize substantial opportunity for the network to enable entrepreneurship. This network allows small business to operate more efficiently; it also expands venture–focused opportunities to build and test new technologies in areas including communications, public safety, security, and clean energy. A broadband network offering ubiquitous access invites increased investment of resources and capital to the area it serves.
                                    <br><br>SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives know that a superior network must be built on superior technology. SeaKay partners with recognized technology leaders including Cisco Systems, IBM and Intel toward ensuring that the most effective and current network is supporting our public benefit mission.
                                    <br><br>Digital Opportunity values what´s already being done by local community organizations, and seeks ways that the network may enhance their success. By keeping local decisions local, we seek reinvestment of community resources back into the community itself, enabling progress and pride to stay right where efforts began. Community reinvestment is a key facet of the Metro Connect network.
                                    <br><br>SeaKay´s Connected Initiatives focus on public safety and first responder needs seeks to ensure a safe, secure, and well–informed community. Consistent with this focus, we deeply value the protection of user privacy.
                                    <br><br>Digital Opportunity recognizes that enabling communities to be better served via ubiquitous network access represents a new untapped investment opportunity. The network builds a community´s social, financial, and knowledge capital, making it ready and eager to participate in the 21st century connected economy.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> We invite interested municipalities and regional entities to contact us to discuss digital opportunity and the wealth of possibilities enabled by the truly open network. Please contact digitalopportunity@seakay.org.</p>

                <li> Management Support SeaKay works with nonprofit organizations to make the most of their administrative resources. SeaKay supports the development of realistic programmatic and organizational development goals, implementing these goals through trainings, coaching and IT support. SeaKay assists in the creation of evaluation criteria to accurately measure progress toward achieving the goals. The processes are straightforward and can be used by all levels of the organization´s staff as well as shared with Board and volunteer leaders.</li>
                <li> Information technology SeaKay is uniquely qualified to assist in the selection and installation of hardware and software to help organizations do their best. Our team can help with a wide range of technology solutions to improve the efficiency of any organization. This spans a full range from computer networking to custom database development. SeaKay has deployed wireless community networks, and worked with organizations to procure and deploy low cost, high–end networking equipment. We can also install, configure, customize, and integrate accounting, constituent management, and fundraising software.</li>
                <li> Financial Management Support SeaKay helps organizations implement the most accurate and least time–consuming methods for monitoring financial systems. We support short term to long term cash flow projections and budget monitoring, and the accurate daily and monthly record keeping that inform annual required audits.

SeaKay can train the organization´s audit committee, and measure the effectiveness of the organization´s internal controls environment. SeaKay helps provide the framework to maximize the adaptability of the financial processes that will guide an organization´s future growth. Our unique mix of hands–on training and follow up as well as customized software solutions help make financial management processes transparent and uncomplicated.
                    <li> Compliance and Program Evaluation Increasingly, nonprofit organizations are obligated to demonstrate how donated resources contribute to the achievement of concrete and measurable results. As philanthropic investment is increasingly seen in terms of a double bottom line – one financial and one programmatic – SeaKay offers comprehensive evaluation methodologies to illustrate to institutional and individual donors the results of key inputs of resources – knowledge, volunteer hours, and funding. For the organization dependent on contributed income, the evidence of well documented and accurately measured outcomes is critical for future planning and the successful competition for increasingly scarce philanthropic resources.</li>

                <li> Fiscal Sponsorship SeaKay offers a range of fiscal sponsorship services to smaller nonprofit organizations that do not have the organizational readiness or desire to seek incorporation and/or tax exempt status for themselves. SeaKay can assist in streamlining administrative and check processing; we can also work in tandem with an audit committee to hone internal controls and financial oversight, and meet state and federal reporting requirements. As a multi–service management support organization, SeaKay has at its disposal a wide range of complementary support services that help supported organizations make the most out of their limited resources. SeaKay can offer this services to foundations that are interested in disengaging themselves from supported organizations. We offer an excellent home for these organizations while maintaining the foundation´s high standards for accountability and performance.</li>
                <li> Research and Reporting SeaKay works with philanthropic institutions and individuals to help clarify their philanthropic goals and achieve them.
